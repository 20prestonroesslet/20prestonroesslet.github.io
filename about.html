                <h1>About Pat's Pizza Place</h1>
                <p>Pat LOVES pizza! Back in 1962, Pat started a tradition of taste that would eventually deliver Pat's Pizza into the national eye. Recognized by people across America, this pizza has earned national honors for robust flavor and affordable prices.</p>

                <p>Founded on a fresh recipe and an even fresher delivery idea, we earned a distinct reputation for hearty authenticity and unconditional taste focus for the serious pizza eater. Starting with our daily hand-tossed dough, mixed with extra virgin olive oil, our pies are then topped with our signature sauce, made from freshly-packed, vine-ripened tomatoes and covered with 100% RealÂ® mozzarella cheese. Each pie is finished off with the freshest of toppings for your enjoyment.</p>

                <p>Pizza is not our only love. Pat enjoys a good plate of pasta, too. Homemade pasta noodles and rich sauces will make you come back for more and more!</p>
